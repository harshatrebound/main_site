use [typeerrors.md](mdc:typeerrors.md), understand them thorughy and fix those errors. My website works ifne in dev mode, FYI.

Act like an expert developer who understands ins and outs of developing a website in Vite and deploying to git. 

Run "npm run build" and keep checking untill we have a production build ready without any errors.
