    "activity_description": "<h3 id=\"\">Overview</h3><p id=\"\">It is a proven fact that a motivated team is a productive team. As important it is, getting people motivated is tougher than ever. High-pressure jobs, being spoilt for options, unstable environment as well as the rapidly changing environment, systems and philosophies are part of the reason. To top that, managers have to deal with people of a different generation and value system. This training program lays emphasis on what determines motivation and how to yield the best outcome from your team.</p><p id=\"\">While a lot of importance is rightly given to talent and skills, organisations fail to keep their employees driven and inspired. For companies to reach the next level and get great profits, the answer lies in an enhanced motivation where employees work with a great vigour, are open to learning and give in their best in every task that they undertake.</p><p id=\"\">The truth is that staff members who feel valued and are acknowledged for the effort tend to take ownership and are more constructive. Magic is especially created when they are self-motivated.
