The next person says their favorite line from another show or movie and so on until everyone has had a turn saying their own favorite line from some other source. Once everyone has had a chance to say their own favorite line, fold up the papers again into halves and pass them around again until each person has had two chances to say their own favorite lines.</p><ol start=\"4\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><a href=\"http://www.trebound.com/team-building-activity/key-punch\" id=\"\">Key Punch</a></li></ol><p id=\"\">In this icebreaker activity, participants will be divided into teams and have the task of collecting keys in a numerical sequence.

If a group member goes out of order or touches a number twice, the entire group has to bear the brunt of penalty.</p><ol start=\"5\" id=\"\"><li id=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.trebound.com/team-building-activity/drum-jam-team-building-session\" id=\"\">Drum Jam Session</a></li></ol><p id=\"\">Drum Jam is a fun way to break down barriers and release energy. Each person in the crowd is given a large percussion instrument, such as a Djembe. The audience uses their hands to pound on the drums to the rhythm, becoming one with the music. The beat of the drum fills everyone with energy and passion, making it easy for everyone to work together as a team.&nbsp; As the beat picks up, so does everyone's level of enthusiasm and involvement.</p><p id=\"\"><strong id=\"\">To sum up</strong></p><p id=\"\">Icebreakers are a great way to make everyone involved feel comfortable and get them to start interacting with each other.
